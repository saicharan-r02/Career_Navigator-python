# 🧭 Career Navigator

Career Navigator is an AI-powered academic analytics platform designed to help engineering students bridge the gap between university grades and professional career paths. By analyzing semester-wise performance through a Random Forest Classifier, the system predicts the most suitable career role and generates a customized, phase-wise roadmap for placement preparation.


# 🎯 Problem Statement

Engineering students often struggle to translate their academic performance into clear career direction and actionable preparation strategies. Existing guidance systems are generic and do not leverage individual academic data to provide personalized recommendations. This project addresses the problem by building a machine learning–driven platform that analyzes semester-wise performance and predicts suitable career roles, along with a structured, phase-wise roadmap for targeted skill development.


# 🚀 Key Features

Dynamic Grade Entry: Interactive UI that adapts to different engineering branches (CSE, AI-ML, etc.) and academic years.

AI-Driven Prediction: Uses Machine Learning to map 50+ subjects into 9 core "Technical Pillars."

Skill Proficiency Dashboard: Visualizes strengths in areas like Coding, Systems, Math, and Hardware.

Actionable Roadmaps: Generates a structured 4-phase plan for the predicted role.

PDF Export: Students can download their personalized career guide for offline use.



# 🛠️ Tech Stack

## Frontend:

React.js (Functional Components & Hooks)

Axios (API Communication)

jsPDF (Document Generation)

CSS3 (Modern Dark-themed UI)

## Backend:

Python (Flask)

Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Model)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)

Flask-CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

# ⚙️ Installation & Setup



## 1. Backend Setup


### Navigate to backend folder
cd backend


### Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors pandas scikit-learn


### Run the Flask server
python predict_logic.py


## 2. Frontend Setup


### Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend


### Install dependencies
npm install


### Start the React development server
npm run dev



# 🧠 How It Works (The Logic)


Data Ingestion: The user selects their branch and inputs grades for completed semesters.

Feature Engineering: The Backend maps every subject to a specific "Pillar" (e.g., Operating Systems → Systems).

Machine Learning: The Random Forest Classifier analyzes the average score of each pillar to identify patterns.

Inference: The model predicts a role (e.g., Data Scientist, Full Stack Developer) based on the highest-weighted skill clusters.
